 <!-- _![NexusNews AI Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x300/0F4C5A/FFFFFF?text=NexusNews+AI) Replace with actual banner/screenshot -->

A modern Android news aggregator app that combines international news APIs with local sources (via web scraping). Powered by OpenRouter AI for intelligent features like auto-summarization, sentiment analysis, multi-language translations, and related article recommendations. Built as a college assignment to explore Jetpack Compose, MVVM, Clean Architecture, and advanced Android patterns.

This app demonstrates production-ready mobile development: offline caching, background sync, secure AI key management, and a polished UI. It's not just a news readerâ€”it's an AI-enhanced discovery tool for personalized news consumption.

## âœ¨ Features

### Core News Aggregation
- **Multi-Source Feed**: Pulls from NewsAPI (international), Guardian (UK/global), and local news sites (via Jsoup scraping).
- **Source Management**: Enable/disable sources, view health status (API availability, scraping success), and filter by category (Tech, Local, Business, Sports).
- **Search & Favorites**: Full-text search with filters; bookmark articles with offline export (JSON/text).

### AI-Powered Enhancements (via OpenRouter)
- **Smart Summarization**: Generate 2-3 sentence summaries in Dutch or English, cached for offline use. Batch mode for feeds.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classify articles as Positive/Neutral/Negative with visual indicators (emojis, colors).
- **Translations**: On-demand NL â†” EN translation with side-by-side views.
- **Topic Extraction**: AI finds key topics and suggests related articles.
- **Model Selection**: Choose from 100+ OpenRouter models (e.g., GPT-4o-mini for speed, Claude for quality); track token usage and costs.
- **Cost Optimization**: Caching, rate limiting, and spending caps to keep API calls efficient.

### Advanced UX/UI
- **Offline-First**: Room DB for caching articles/summaries; background sync with WorkManager.
- **Notifications**: Breaking news alerts with pre-generated AI summaries.
- **Accessibility**: Reading time estimates, Text-to-Speech (TTS), and Material 3 themes (light/dark).
- **Polish**: Infinite scrolling, animations (Compose), haptic feedback, and onboarding flow for preferences.

### Architecture Highlights
- **MVVM + Clean Architecture**: Presentation (Compose UI), Domain (Use Cases/Entities), Data (Repositories/Adapters).
- **Reactive UI**: StateFlow for real-time updates (e.g., feed refresh, AI loading).
- **Background Services**: Workers for prefetching and health checks.
- **Security**: Encrypted storage for OpenRouter API keys (Android Keystore).
